This file explains the format of each data used. 

(1) each-station-lambda-31days.csv
    a. this file contains totally n rows, where n is the number of ambulance stations in the simulation (e.g. n = 34 in paper [1]). 
    b. each row has T values separated by ',', where T is the number of hours in the simulation (e.g. T = 31 * 24 if we simulate 31 days as in paper [1]). 

(2) ems_requests.ext
    a. this file records all EMS requests used in simulation.
    b. each row is an EMS request, with its time and location (road vertex id).

(3) hospitals.txt
    a. this file contains all hospitals used in simulation.
    b. each row is the location (road vertex id) of a hospital.

(4) stations.txt
    a. this file contains all ambulance stations used in simulation.
    b. each row is the location (road vertex id) of an ambulance station.

(5) travel_time_between_road_vertex.txt
    a. this file contains the travel time of any two vertices.
    b. the data format of each row is: road_vertex_id_1, road_vertex_id_2, travel_time (in second).

Note that we only provide some data samples for each file, since we are not allowed to release the data.
